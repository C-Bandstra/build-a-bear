# Build-A-Bear

## Description

Build-A-Bear is a simple family-friendly game that allows you to add different clothing, accessories, and backgrounds to an image of a Teddy Bear. You can add one item from each button category to create an outfit. The sections are as follows: hats, clothes, accessories, and backgrounds. On page load you start off with a bear that has no images on it. You can then add and remove images from the different categories, and once you have dressed the bear to your liking, you can give the outfit a name in the input field and press save. A card will appear on the right side of the screen with the outfit title. If you click in the body of the card that outfit will re-appear on the bear. If you reload the page all of your saved outfits will reload as well. If you click the x icon in the bottom right section of the card that outfit will be permanently deleted.
